# Egbor Paul Ehizojie

Hello, welcome to my Github home page! My name is Egbor Paul Ehizojie and I am a full stack software engineer. I am currently undertaking a software engineering program at ALX. My focus is primarily on front-end development, but I am also interested in backend development and graphic design. 

I have a passion for creating beautiful, functional, and intuitive interfaces that users can enjoy. I am also skilled in using tools such as Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign, which I use to create stunning graphics and designs.

I am excited to be part of the Github community, where I can share my work and collaborate with other developers. I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow as a developer and designer.

Thank you for taking the time to visit my Github home page. If you have any questions or would like to collaborate, please feel free to reach out to me.
